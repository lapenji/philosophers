# philosophers

Philosophers is a concurrent programming project assigned by 42 coding school. The project involves implementing a simulation of the dining philosophers problem, which is a classic problem in computer science that demonstrates the challenges of resource allocation in a multi-threaded environment. In the simulation, a group of philosophers sit at a round table and share a limited number of forks. The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating, but to eat, they need to hold two forks simultaneously. The project requires students to implement a solution to the problem using different synchronization techniques, such as mutexes and semaphores. Students also need to handle edge cases, such as deadlocks and starvation, and optimize their implementation for performance. The project tests the students' understanding of concurrent programming concepts and their ability to solve complex synchronization problems in a multi-threaded environment
